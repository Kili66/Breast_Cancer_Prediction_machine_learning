2- KFold
2- SuPPORT Vector Machine (SVM)
In this impactful machine learning endeavor, I focused on predicting breast cancer outcomes by employing a strategic combination of powerful algorithms. The primary algorithms used in this project include:

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
* Leveraging PCA, I aimed to distill the essential features from the dataset, reducing dimensionality while retaining critical information. This approach enhances the model's efficiency and interpretability, contributing to more accurate predictions.

### KFold Cross-Validation:
To ensure the robustness of the model, I implemented KFold cross-validation, a technique that partitions the dataset into multiple subsets. This process provides a thorough assessment of the model's performance across different data splits, enhancing its generalization capabilities.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
* SVM, a powerful classification algorithm, was employed to discern patterns within the data and make predictions based on intricate relationships. The use of SVM adds a layer of sophistication to the model, enabling it to capture complex dependencies in the breast cancer dataset.

* The project achieved a commendable accuracy of 97%, underscoring the effectiveness of the chosen algorithms in accurately predicting breast cancer outcomes. This high accuracy not only demonstrates the robustness of the model but also highlights my proficiency in implementing machine learning techniques for impactful healthcare predictions.

* By successfully integrating PCA, KFold cross-validation, and SVM, this project showcases my adeptness in leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to contribute to critical areas such as breast cancer prediction.
